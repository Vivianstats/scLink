Introduction
------------

Any suggestions on the package are welcome! For technical problems, please report to [Issues](https://github.com/Vivianstats/scLink/issues). For suggestions and comments on the method, please contact Vivian (<vivian.li@rutgers.edu>).

You can also browse scLink's applications and results at its [web app](https://rutgersbiostat.shinyapps.io/sclink/).

Installation
------------

The package is available on CRAN. For installation please use the following codes in `R`
``` r
install.packages("scLink")
```


Quick start
-----------

`scLink` has three main functions:

-   `sclink_norm` for pre-processing gene expression data
-   `sclink_cor` for calculating the co-expression matrix by scLink
-   `sclink_net` for constructing the gene co-expression network by scLink

For detailed usage, please refer to the package [manual](https://github.com/Vivianstats/scLink/blob/master/inst/docs/) or [vignette](https://github.com/Vivianstats/scLink/blob/master/vignettes/).
